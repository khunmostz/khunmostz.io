            At Nexunify, I integrated the UI Connect API (RESTful), implemented push notifications, and utilized native code to enhance performance. I connected BLE medical devices, published applications to the App Store and Google Play Store, and built white-label solutions for clients. Additionally, I worked on various development tasks to improve app stability, security, and user experience.
